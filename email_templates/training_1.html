   <h1 style="font-size: 130%; font-family:Georgia, serif; ">Reverence For Life</h1>
   <i>
   <p style="" >Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I am committed to cultivating the insight of interbeing and compassion and learning ways to protect the lives of people, animals, plants, and minerals.</p>
   <p style="" >I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to support any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, or in my way of life.</p>
   <p style="" >Seeing that harmful actions arise from anger, fear, greed, and intolerance, which in turn come from dualistic and discriminative thinking, I will cultivate openness, non-discrimination, and non-attachment to views in order to transform violence, fanaticism, and dogmatism in myself and in the world.</p>
